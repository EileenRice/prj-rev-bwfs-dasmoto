<!-- Based on the "specs" given, I did this web page after I had already did my own. This current one, looks basic and not overly attractive.  SO below this html file and the subsequent css files, I'm including the original web site I attempted.  That said, it probably needs to be improved as my current skills are lacking, but I am pleased with my first attempt. Thanks for looking at it.-->

<!-- Here is the code of my first design. I look forward to getting feedback and critiques.

  I used a second p element to get the text and images to line up.  Regular span and div weren't getting the right look I was attempting.  There probably is a much better way to do it, I just don't know how. I also noticed on Slack most people were trying to stay close to the example given.  I found it unattractive, so I hope I don't get penalised for drawing outside the lines by creating a new look.
